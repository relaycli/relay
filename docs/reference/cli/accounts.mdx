What those CLI commands are for:
- connecting email accounts
- testing the connection with your credentials (stored locally, encrypted with a key you own)

What they're not for:
- creating or deleting email accounts

Should you need help with the CLI syntax, you can always invoke:
```shell
relay accounts --help
```

## Connect an email account

Add a new IMAP account with interactive setup. The CLI will auto-detect your email provider and configure the appropriate settings.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Interactive Setup">
```shell
relay accounts add
```

Follow the prompts to enter your account details. The CLI will guide you through:
- Account name (for reference)
- Email address
- Provider selection (auto-detected when possible)
- Password (with confirmation)
- Server settings (auto-configured for known providers)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Non-Interactive Setup">
```shell
relay accounts add \
  --name "work" \
  --email "user@company.com" \
  --provider custom \
  --imap-server "imap.company.com" \
  --imap-port 993
```

<Info>
For Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and iCloud, the CLI will automatically configure the correct server settings for `imap-server` and `imap-port`.
