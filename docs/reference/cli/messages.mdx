What those CLI commands are for:
- reading emails from your connected accounts
- sorting/processing them

What they're not for:
- sending bulk email campaigns (we love [Resend](https://resend.com) for that)

Should you need help with the CLI syntax, you can always invoke:
```shell
relay messages --help
```

<Info>In IMAP, emails are bound to a folder. So if you move an email to another folder, it will create a new UID.
Consider the MIME email head Message-ID if you want a global unique identifier for an email</Info>
