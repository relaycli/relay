What those CLI commands are for:
- reading emails from your connected accounts
- sorting/processing them

What they're not for:
- sending bulk email campaigns (we love [Resend](https://resend.com) for that)

Should you need help with the CLI syntax, you can always invoke:
```shell
relay messages --help
```

<Info>In IMAP, emails are bound to a folder. So if you move an email to another folder, it will create a new UID.
Consider the MIME email head Message-ID if you want a global unique identifier for an email</Info>

## List your recent emails

Display your recent emails in a formatted table with UID, timestamp, sender, subject, and snippet.

```shell
relay messages list
```

**Alias:** `relay messages ls`

Shows the 20 most recent emails from your first configured account.

### Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--account` | `-a` | Account name to use | First configured account |
| `--limit` | `-l` | Number of messages to fetch | 20 |
| `--unread` | `-u` | Show only unread messages | false |

<Check>
The table displays: UID, Timestamp (UTC), From, Subject, and Snippet for easy scanning.
</Check>

## Search your inbox

Search for messages containing specific text in the subject, sender, or body.


```shell
relay messages search "meeting"
```

**Aliases:** `relay messages find`, `relay messages grep`

Searches through the most recent 100 messages for the term "meeting".

### Search behavior

The search function:
- Searches in subject lines, sender addresses, and message body text
- Is case-insensitive
- Returns results sorted by date (newest first)
- Shows the same table format as the list command

<Tip>
Use specific search terms to narrow down results. The search looks through subject, sender, and body content.
</Tip>

### Options

## Read a specific email

### Message display

The command shows:
- **Message Details**: UID, timestamp, subject
- **Headers**: From, CC, BCC

<Info>
The UID is specific to each account and folder. You can get UIDs from the `relay messages list` command.
