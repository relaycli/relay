<Accordion title="What problem does Relay solve?">
  Building apps that **read, classify, and react to e-mail** is still painful—rate-limited Gmail APIs or raw IMAP sockets.
  Relay gives you a modern CLI and library to manage emails locally, with clean Python APIs for building email-powered applications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get started?">
  Install the CLI with `pip install relaycli`, then run `relay accounts add` to connect your first email account.
  The [quickstart guide](/documentation/getting-started/quickstart) walks you through the entire setup in under 5 minutes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which email providers are supported?">
  Any inbox that speaks IMAP/SMTP: Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, FastMail, or your own Dovecot/Postfix server.
  The same CLI commands work across all of them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are my credentials stored?">
  All credentials are stored locally on your machine, encrypted using your OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service).
  Nothing is sent to external servers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different from Gmail API or other email APIs?">
  * **Gmail API** → Google-only, strict quotas, complex OAuth flows.
  * **SaaS email APIs** → cloud-locked, proprietary, often read-only, expensive.
  * **Relay** → open-source, runs locally, works with any IMAP provider, full read/write access, free.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What can I build with Relay?">
  * Email automation scripts and bots
  * Custom email clients or dashboards
  * Smart auto-responders and filters
  * Integration with other business tools
  * Voice-controlled email interfaces

  If it involves reading, searching, or managing emails, you can build it with Relay.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I manage multiple email accounts?">
  Yes! Connect unlimited email accounts with `relay accounts add` and switch between them or manage them all simultaneously.
  Each account gets its own secure credential storage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Relay free to use?">
  Yes! The core Relay CLI and library are completely free and open-source.
  Optional cloud services may be introduced in the future, but the local functionality will always remain free.
