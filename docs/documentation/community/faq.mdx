<Accordion title="What problem does Relay solve?">
  Building apps that **read, classify, and react to e-mail** is still painful—rate-limited Gmail APIs or raw IMAP sockets.
  Relay gives you a modern JSON/HTTP layer you can run locally or in our cloud, so you ship mail-powered features in minutes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different from Gmail API or Nylas-style SaaS email APIs?">
  * Gmail API → Google-only, strict quotas.
  * Typical SaaS email APIs → cloud-locked, proprietary, often read-only.
  **Relay is open-source infrastructure:** IMAP + SMTP under the hood, REST/Webhooks on top. Run it anywhere; upgrade to our cloud only for push sync and AI add-ons.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which providers are supported?">
  Any inbox that speaks IMAP/SMTP: Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, FastMail, or your own Dovecot/Postfix server.
  The same endpoint shape works across all of them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you store my e-mail passwords?">
  * **Self-host:** secrets stay on your disk, encrypted with your OS keychain.
  * **Cloud:** we store OAuth tokens when available; otherwise the password is client-encrypted—our servers see only ciphertext.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I self-host? And what does the cloud cost?">
  Yes. `docker compose up` gives you the core for free under Apache-2.0.
  Our managed cloud is pay-as-you-go: e-mail sync is free; you pay only for optional extras like voice TTS/STT and large-model triage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does it handle multiple inboxes?">
  Unlimited. Each account you connect appears as its own `/accounts/{id}` namespace, and you can stream events from all of them in a single webhook.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What can I build with it?">
  * Voice-controlled inboxes
  * Smart auto-responders
  * Billing/receipt parsers
  * Support-desk bots
  * Custom e-mail clients or analytics dashboards
  If it needs to read or act on mail, you can prototype it in under 50 lines.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I migrate from Gmail API?">
  Swap your token for IMAP credentials (or Gmail’s OAuth IMAP scope) and point your HTTP calls to `/messages` and `/threads`—the response shape matches Gmail’s list/get endpoints. Our step-by-step guide covers pagination, labels, and webhooks.
</Accordion>
