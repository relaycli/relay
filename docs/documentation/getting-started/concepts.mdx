<Note>Why read this? You don’t need to memorize every RFC to use Relay, but a 5-minute tour of the landscape helps you debug faster — and impress friends at parties.</Note>

## Standards & Governance

### IETF
Internet Engineering Task Force – the community that writes the open specifications powering e-mail, HTTP, TLS, etc.
All core mail specs are “RFCs” (Request for Comments) published by the IETF.

### RFC
A numbered document that defines a protocol. Example: RFC 5322 specifies e-mail headers.
Every server and client that follows the same RFC can inter-operate – that’s why you can fetch Gmail via Apple Mail.

## Anatomy of an email
* Headers: key-value pairs describing sender, recipients, threading
* Body: one or more <Tooltip tip="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</Tooltip> “parts” (plain text, HTML, PDF, images)

```shell email example
Headers
  From:       alice@example.com
  To:         bob@example.org
  Subject:    Weekly sync?
  Message-ID: <CA123@example.com>
  In-Reply-To:<B7@example.org>

Body (plain text or HTML + attachments)
```

## Email Protocols
* <Tooltip tip="Internet Messaging Access Protocol">IMAP</Tooltip> (RFC 3501) — read & organize mail.
* IDLE (RFC 2177) — real-time notifications.
* <Tooltip tip="Post Office Protocol">POP3</Tooltip> (RFC 1939) — download and delete mail.
* <Tooltip tip="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</Tooltip> (RFC 5321) — send mail.
* <Tooltip tip="JSON Meta Application Protocol">JMAP</Tooltip> (RFC 8620) — modern JSON read/send.


## From Server to App: Who Does What?

| Layer | Acronym | Example software | What it does |
| ----- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Mail Transfer Agent | MTA | Postfix, Exim | Routes SMTP traffic between domains. |
| Mail Delivery Agent | MDA | Dovecot, Courier | Saves incoming mail to the user’s mailbox. |
| Mail User Agent | MUA | Outlook, Thunderbird | <Tooltip tip="Graphical User Interface">GUI</Tooltip> that people click. |
| Relay | - | (open-core) | Sits between MUA and IMAP, giving dev-friendly JSON + webhooks. |

## Providers vs. Clients
* Provider = organization hosting an MTA/MDA (Gmail, Outlook, Proton, your own VPS).
* Client = anything that logs in to read or send mail (iOS Mail, Superhuman, your script).

Relay treats every provider the same as long as it offers IMAP/SMTP. Your code talks to a single /messages endpoint.

## Email APIs vs. Delivery APIs

Both provide programmable access to email-related operations.

| Category | Examples | Focus |
| -------- | -------- | ----- |
| Delivery APIs | Resend, SendGrid, SES | High-volume outbound (newsletters, receipts). |
| Interaction APIs | Relay | Read, search, tag, reply, build full apps. |

Use both together: Resend for blasts, Relay for smart follow-ups.

## Key Terminology in Relay

| Term | Short definition |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Email account | IMAP/SMTP credential set you connect |
| Message | A single e-mail, defined by its Message-ID or IMAP UID. |
| Thread | All messages sharing References/In-Reply-To headers |
| Label | User-defined tag saved server-side; survives new messages. |
