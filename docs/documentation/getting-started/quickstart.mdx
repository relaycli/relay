        Message Body:
        The migration is done. Obviously.

        While you were all probably panicking about downtime (which never happened), 
        I successfully migrated our entire server infrastructure to the new data center.

        Key accomplishments:
        - Migrated 47 servers in 3.2 hours
        - Implemented redundant failsafes
        - Optimized database queries by 340%
        - Fixed 23 security vulnerabilities

        Richard, the system is now running at 99.97% efficiency. The remaining 0.03% 
        is due to the laws of physics, which even I cannot override.

        Dinesh, I've documented everything in a way that even you might comprehend, 
        though I make no guarantees.

        The servers are purring like a well-fed cat. You may now return to your 
        regularly scheduled mediocrity.

        Message Body:
        Actually Gilfoyle, your code has a memory leak in the compression algorithm.
        I've already fixed it. You're welcome.
