## Why we built it

We started Relay to power a voice-first executive assistant for founders.
Google’s “CASA” quotas throttled our Gmail integration. IMAP was universal—but clunky.
So we wrapped IMAP/SMTP in a clean REST layer, open-sourced it, and added optional cloud extras (push sync, AI triage, TTS/STT). Now anyone can build on e-mail like Stripe on payments.
