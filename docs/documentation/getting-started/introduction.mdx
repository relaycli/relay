## Why we built it

Email is a billion-person communication protocol, but building on it sucks.
We hit this wall building a voice assistant for founders when we received the bill for the security audit to validate Gmail permissions. You can read the full story [here](https://relaycli.com/manifesto).
So we built Relay: a clean, local-first CLI and Python library that handles the complexity while keeping you in control. No middlemen, no data harvesting, no artificial limits.

## What you can build

Parse receipts into spreadsheets. Build auto-responders that actually understand context. Create support bots that route emails intelligently. Extract attachments in bulk. Build full email clients.
The infrastructure is here. The data is yours. The possibilities are endless.
