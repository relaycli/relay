Relay is an **open-source CLI and Python library** that turns any **IMAP-compatible** inbox into a clean, developer-friendly interface in under five minutes.
Build voice agents, auto-responders, support bots, or full-blown e-mail clients—without touching MIME, OAuth hoops, or UID gymnastics.

## Why we built it

We started Relay to power a voice-first executive assistant for founders.
Google's "CASA" quotas throttled our Gmail integration. IMAP was universal—but clunky.
So we built a clean CLI and Python library that wraps IMAP/SMTP complexity, made it open-source, and designed it for developers who want to build on email without the headaches.
