# Project overview
This project's goal is to enable builders to create email-based apps

## Success metrics
- Reduction in time-to-zero-inbox for daily emails
- Number of active users of email apps

## Functional requirements
### General
- Stay lean, keep a minimal set of well-picked dependencies. The leanest codebase can lead to the greatest achievements
- Keep the codebase modular
- Respect Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) rules

### Relay library
- Handle email account management (IMAP, Gmail, Outlook)
- Implements all common email operations that you can experience with email clients
- Credentials are stored locally
- The implementation should be optimized for speed and concept persistence

### Relay CLI
- Wrap the library in a CLI interface
- The UI should be designed so that it becomes easy for developers to manage their emails using their terminal

### Documentation
- Fast track the installation, usage and contribution of users

### Backend API
- Allow users to host online a REST API to develop email-based services
- Handle user authentication (OAuth 2 using JWT as bearer tokens)
- Handle OAuth connections (Google account)
- Enable the fetching and labeling of emails (metadata in relational database + image/video in storage)
